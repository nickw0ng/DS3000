    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "Submit this `ipynb` file to Gradescope (this can also be done via the assignment on Canvas).  To ensure that your submitted files represent your latest code, make sure to give a fresh `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the files to gradescope.\n",

    "- Start early\n",
    "- Make use of Piazza\n",
    "- Make use of Office hour\n",
    "- Remember to use cells and headings to make the notebook easy to read (if a grader cannot find the answer to a problem, you will receive no points for it)\n",
    "- Under no circumstances may one student view or share their ungraded homework or quiz with another student [(see also)](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity), though you are welcome to **talk about** (not show each other) the problems."

    "The mean value of rating their programming skills is higher for students who have not been in co-op. I think this is because those who haven’t been in a co-op are not exposed to all the things that they do not know, therefore rate their skills higher. In addition, those who have been on co-op are statistically older than those who have not. Next, those who know python statistically rate their programming experience higher than those who do not. Finally, the ability to know python does not affect age."
