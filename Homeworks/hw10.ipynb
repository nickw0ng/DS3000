    "## Part 1: Decision Tree (35 total points)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem you will use the `df_owl_2018.csv` file again in your Homework Module on Canvas. This data set contains statistics from the 2018 Overwatch League (cleaned from [this website](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab?statslab=heroes)). Overwatch is a video game where two teams of 6 players compete against each other. On each team, a player may assume one of three roles:\n",
    "- Damage: whose job is to attack the other team\n",
    "- Support: whose job is to heal their own team\n",
    "- Tank: whose job is to absorb the damage of the other team\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while those are the general jobs of each role, occasionally a player in one role behaves more like another. In this part, we will see if the numeric statistics from a game of Overwatch can be used to accurately predict the role of a player using a Decision Tree."
